# ML_image_improvement
Course assignment for IMPR course at HUJI. Code for training three ML models that accept images as input. Each improves a different aspect of the picture.

### Details
Tragically, I don't own the data used to train these models. This makes this code unusable, until I can find a replacement. The code is presented here for the kind and beatiful recruiter to see, be impressed, and then (probably) ignore completely.

**Side Note:** If you're a IMPR student and came here for (*ahem*) assisstance, I should note I did leave usage examples in the code, commented-out. Hopefully someone will find this helpful.
